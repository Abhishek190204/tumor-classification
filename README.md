# tumor-classification
A machine learning project which uses different models to classify tumors as benign or malignant

## Perceptron
PM1 is a regular perceptron model
PM2 is the same model but with the dataset shuffled and processed randomly
PM3 uses normalized data
PM4 shuffles the order of the features of the dataset

## Fischer's Linear Discriminant 
It contains two models, with the second model using a random permutation of the features of the given dataset.

## Logistic Regresssion
This includes models working at different learning rates and compares between using normalized and regular data.
Different gradient descent techniques like Batch Gradient Descent, Mini-batch Gradient Descent, and Stochastic Gradient  Descent are used.
